## Repository layout
These files intentionally live directly under:

`kspf2pgatheringprofit/`

The Java package remains:

`net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.kspf2pgatheringprofit`

This matches the raw source layout used by the KSP release/source-loader repository.

## Local Microbot-Hub build
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build -PpluginList=KspF2pGatheringProfitPlugin
```

The release repository itself does not contain the complete Microbot Gradle project, so a full Java compile still needs the matching local Microbot-Hub checkout.
