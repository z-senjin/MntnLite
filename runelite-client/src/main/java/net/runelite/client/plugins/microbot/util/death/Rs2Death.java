/**
 * Death recovery for a normal death: locating the grave, looting it (paying the retrieval fee when
 * required), and falling back to Death's Office once the grave has expired.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here runs on its own. A script polls from its loop and decides what to do:
 * <pre>
 * if (Rs2Death.hasDeathToHandle()) {
 *     Rs2Death.recoverItems(config.deathBudget());   // grave only; 0 = free items only
 *     return State.BANK;                             // script re-gears however it already does
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Death's Office is opt-in, because its fee is uncapped and cannot be read before it is charged:
 * <pre>
 * Rs2Death.recoverItems(config.deathBudget(), true);
 * </pre>
 * The office charges an uncapped fee that it never shows before charging it, so there is deliberately no
 * spending cap here — one would be fiction. A script that wants to decide for itself can walk there,
 * inspect the contents, and back out without paying; only the reclaim costs anything:
 * <pre>
 * if (Rs2Death.walkToDeathsOffice() &amp;&amp; Rs2Death.enterDeathsOffice() &amp;&amp; Rs2Death.openDeathsOffice()) {
 *     Rs2Death.reclaimAll();          // or inspect first and call closeInterfaces() to decline
 *     Rs2Death.closeInterfaces();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Use {@link #getPredictedGraveFee()} when you want a real number: it reads the figure the game itself
 * computed on the Items Kept on Death panel, rather than estimating one.
 * <p>
 * Or drive the steps directly — {@link #walkToGrave()}, {@link #openGrave()},
 * {@link #getGraveFee()}, {@link #lootGraveFreeItems()}, {@link #lootGravePaidItems(int)} — when the
 * script wants its own logic between them.
 * <p>
 * {@code recoverItems} and the {@code lootGrave*} / {@code reclaimAll} methods take <b>everything</b>.
 * To take only some of it, inspect first and filter:
 * <pre>
 * Rs2Death.openGrave();
 * Rs2Death.lootGraveItems(i -&gt; i.getName().contains("rune"));   // leaves the rest
 *
 * Rs2Death.openDeathsOffice();
 * Rs2Death.reclaimItems(i -&gt; i.getId() == ItemID.DRAGON_SCIMITAR);
 * </pre>
 * {@link #getGraveFreeItems()}, {@link #getGravePaidItems()} and {@link #getDeathsOfficeItems()} show
 * what is waiting. Note the asymmetry: the office charges per item reclaimed, so taking less costs less,
 * whereas a grave's fee covers its whole paid half at once. And anything left in a <b>grave</b> is only
 * safe until the timer expires — it then moves to Death's Office at the higher fee — while anything left
 * with Death keeps indefinitely.
 * <p>
 * Items left behind are not destroyed; they keep in Death's Office indefinitely.
 * <p>
 * Fee schedules, for reference — this class never computes them, it reads what the game reports:
 * a <b>grave</b> charges flat coin amounts per item by tier (1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 for 100k–1m /
 * 1m–10m / 10m+), total capped at 500,000; <b>Death's Office</b> charges an uncapped 5%. Both test the
 * item's <i>unit</i> price against 100,000, so a large stack of cheap items is free from either —
 * confirmed in game with 862 coal at 146 each. Ironmen pay half. Documented exceptions exist and do not
 * follow the unit-price rule (a stack of amulet of glory (6) over 100,000 is charged 10% at the office),
 * which is why nothing here estimates a fee.
 * <p>
 * The first-death Death's Domain tutorial is <b>not</b> handled here — that stays with
 * {@link net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.util.events.DeathEvent}, which normally only fires once
 * per account.
