/**
 * Death's Office entrances, one beside each major respawn point. Each is marked by a tombstone icon on
 * the minimap and leads to the same office, so the nearest is always the right choice.
 * <p>
 * Entry is through a {@code Death's Domain} object
 * ({@link net.runelite.api.gameval.ObjectID1#DEATH_OFFICE_ACCESS_GRAVE}, id 38426) with the action
 * {@code Enter Death's Domain} — see {@link Rs2Death#enterDeathsOffice()}.
 * <p>
 * {@link #LUMBRIDGE} is verified in-game against the actual object. The other seven come from the wiki's
 * map data, cross-checked against it: every x matches the wiki exactly, and every y sits a constant two
 * tiles south of the wiki's figure (four at Lumbridge). A uniform offset across all eight, on the one
 * entry with a known ground truth, says the wiki centres its map slightly north of the object rather than
 * on it — so these values are the better estimate of the object tile, not a worse one.
 * <p>
 * Either way the margin is irrelevant: {@link Rs2Death#walkToDeathsOffice()} only has to get close enough
 * for the entrance object to load into the scene, and {@link Rs2Death#enterDeathsOffice()} then finds it
 * by <b>id</b>, never by coordinate. A few tiles of drift costs nothing. The {@code landmark} field
 * records what each point is meant to sit beside.
